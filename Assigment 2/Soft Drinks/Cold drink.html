    <h1>Cold Drink</h1>
    <p>This list has plenty of cold drink recipes to choose from. The one thing they all share in common is that they’re
        healthy*! No refined sugar or processed, junky ingredients to be found – thank goodness. In our sugar-obsessed,
        artificial-everything world, this in and of itself is a feat.
