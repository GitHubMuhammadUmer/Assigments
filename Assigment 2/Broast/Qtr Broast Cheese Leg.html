    <h1>Qtr Broast Leg</h1>
    <p>The quarters are our favorite cut of chicken. We love white meat too, but dark meat is juicier and more
        flavorful. I try to buy and use a whole chicken whenever possible, but truth is, when it comes to cutting a
        whole roast chicken, everyone seems to want to have the thighs or the drumsticks</p>
