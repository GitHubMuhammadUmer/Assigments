    <h1>Chicken Mayo Garlic Roll</h1>
    <p>A quick chicken sandwich that can be made under 10 minutes with mixed veggies, spiced chicken chunks and mayo. If
        you have all the ingredients ready you will take just 10 minutes to saute the chicken and prepare it. The
        simplest way is to make this on a griddle/ tawa but you can also grill it in a grill pan or a sandwich griller
        or toaster what ever you have.</p>
