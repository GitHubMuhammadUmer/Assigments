    <h1>Chicken Cheese Roll</h1>
    <p>Combine the chicken and cheese. Stuff the crescent rolls with the chicken mixture, then roll up. Place each
        stuffed crescent roll (seam-side down) in the sauce. Bake until golden brown and cooked through! Pair the cheesy
        chicken crescent rolls with a green vegetable or side salad for a complete meal.
