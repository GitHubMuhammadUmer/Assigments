    <h1>Chicken White Karahi</h1>
    <p>A super quick, Pakistani-style Chicken Brown Karahi Recipe By Chef Zakir, in which chicken is cooked in a yogurt
        and black pepper based sauce. Make it with freshly crushes black pepper (kali mirch) for maximum taste. Goes
        great with Raita and Naan.</p>
