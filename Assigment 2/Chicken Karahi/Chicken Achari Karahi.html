    <h1>Chicken Achari Karahi</h1>
    <p>Achari Chicken which literally means "pickled" chicken is made with pickling spices. This North Indian curry uses
        an unbelievably flavorful combination of spices such as fennel seeds, nigella seeds, and fenugreek seeds for a
        warm, rich, pickle-flavored curry with smokey aromas</p>
