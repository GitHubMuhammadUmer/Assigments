    <h1>Regular Pizza</h1>
    <p>When you choose a Brooklyn Style Crust, you can get a large, but you can also choose extra large — that’s a 16
        incher! When you select the build—your—own pizza option, you’ll see exactly what pizza size you can order
        relative to your favorite crust. When you order online, the default size for our Specialty Pizzas is large.</p>
