    <h1>Pan Pizza</h1>
    <p>By now, everybody and their baker's heard about no-knead dough. It's a technique that was developed by Jim Lahey
        of Sullivan Street Bakery and popularized by Mark Bittman of the New York Times. The basic premise is simple:
        Mix together your dough ingredients in a bowl just until they're combined, cover the bowl, and let time take
        care of the rest. </p>
