    <h1>Chicken Sandwich </h1>
    <p>The sandwich usually consists of a chicken filet or patty, toppings and bread. The chicken meat can be deep
        fried, grilled, roasted or boiled, served hot or cold, and white or dark meat chicken can be used. Shredded
        chicken in one form or another, such as chicken salad, can also be used in chicken sandwiches.</p>
