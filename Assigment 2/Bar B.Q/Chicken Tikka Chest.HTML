    <h1>Chicken Tikka Chest</h1>
    <p>The word “Tikka” literally means “a piece or chunk” and here chicken tikka are grilled chunks of chicken that are
        first marinated in spiced & herbed yogurt and then char-grilled to perfection. These smoky and aromatic tender
        chunks are simmered in a creamy, delicious and flavoursome onion tomato masala, known as Tikka Masala.</p>
