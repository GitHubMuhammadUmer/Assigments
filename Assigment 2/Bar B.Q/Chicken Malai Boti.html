    <h1>Chicken Malai Boti </h1>
    <p>Malai means cream and boti means bites of chicken. Chicken Malai Boti gets its name from its extremely tender,
        melt-in-the mouth texture. It is also sometimes referred to as Malai Chicken Tikkaor Murgh Malai Tikka. It's a
        luscious Pakistani BBQ delicacy made with chicken marinated in a cream and yogurt sauce.</p>
