    <h1>Chicken Macaroni</h1>
    <p>Macaroni. You can honestly use any type of quick cooking pasta here, but I used macaroni that cooks in 3 minutes
        and we were all happy about it. You can make this as healthy as you want, by now Iâ€™ve even seen cauliflower
        pasta. Chicken. We used rotisserie chicken, specifically the meat of the chicken thighs. Mozzarella.</p>
