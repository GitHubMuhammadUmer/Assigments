    <h1>Beef Chowmein </h1>
    <p>It makes the beef bits stick to the noodles better, with the added bonus of upping the protein. Another bonus:
        chow mein actually has a vast amount of noodle-shaped vegetables hidden in the noodles. A carrot, 2 heaped cups
        of cabbage and a heaped cup of bean sprouts. Thatâ€™s a good veg serving for a meal!</p>
