  </i>
  </br>
  <p>
    The PCB's proposed hybrid model for the Asia Cup is likely to be approved by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC),
    <i>
      with Sri Lanka as the neutral venue where India can play their games.
    </i>
    <b>
      The model sees four - and possibly five - of the tournament's 13 games being played in Pakistan.
    </b>
  </p>

  <p>
    All the India-Pakistan games will be played in Sri Lanka, as will the final if India is involved.

    ESPNcricinfo understands an official announcement is likely after the weekend.
    <b>
      The window set aside for the tournament currently is between September 1-17.
    </b>
    <i>
      For the Pakistan leg, the games are likely to be played in Lahore
    </i>
