    <i>The global coronavirus outbreak hit the capital market badly as it witnessed the worst week</i> in more than
    two and a half years and slumped by 5.6%, dealers said, expecting the situation to persist, reported The News on
    Sunday.

      “The coronavirus continued to keep a firm grip on local headlines, as the number of reported cases increased in
      Italy
      and neighbouring Iran, while a couple of cases were also identified in Pakistan,” Ahmed Lakhani, a JS Global
      analyst said.

  The panicky scenario was naturally not exclusive to Pakistan, with most major regional and global markets receding
  during the week.

    “Not in one session did the market close in the green zone, remaining firmly etched in red,” he said, according to
    the publication.
