    <h2 align="center">Pakistan gets first shipment of Russian crude under discount deal</h2>
  </i>
  </br>
  <p>
    Pakistan has received its first shipment of Russian crude oil under an agreement signed between the two countries in
    April,
    but experts believe it will be too soon to say if the deal will provide significant benefit to domestic consumers.

    <i>
      The cargo carrying 45,000 metric tonnes of crude oil arrived at the southern city of
      <b>
        Karachi on Sunday while another 50,000 metric tonnes is expected to arrive later this week,
      </b>
      according to the Pakistan Refinery Limited (PRL)
    </i>, where the crude oil will be processed.
  </p>
  Russia has been slapped with sanctions from the Western powers after it invaded Ukraine last year,
  cutting its oil and gas exports to the European Union and the United States.
  <i>
    The Pakistan deal gives Moscow a new oil market after India and China as the Ukraine conflict rages on.
  </i>

  Musadik Malik,
  <b>
    Pakistanâ€™s junior minister for petroleum,
  </b>
  told a private news channel on Monday that petrol prices in the country will fall once the supply from Russia starts
  on a regular basis
